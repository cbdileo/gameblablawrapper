DESCRIPTION
=============

What the hell is this ?

The Gameblabla's Wrapper is an ANSI C library, its goal is to simplify the development of cross-platform games.
It was originally designed to enable cross-platform development without using an emulator for 3DO.
It is now available for several platforms and it is mostly suited for simple single-screen games. 
(You can do scrolling games too but you will have to copy each tile individually in memory, this might get fixed in the future)

With the Gameblabla's Wrapper, you can :
- Draw Pixels on screen
- Move images and sprites
- Play music and sound effects
- Play with a keyboard or a controller

All of this with the same piece of code !
The only differences are the limitations of each platform and library.

You can also use it as a reference or a teaching tool if you want to know how to use SDL 2.0 for example.
