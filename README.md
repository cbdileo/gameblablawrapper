DESCRIPTION
=============

What the hell is this ?

The Gameblabla's Wrapper is an ANSI C library whose goal is to simplify the development of cross-platform games.
It was originally designed to enable cross-platform development without using an emulator for 3DO.
It is now available for several platforms and it is suited for simple single-screen games. 
(You can do scrolling games too but you will have to copy each tile individually in memory)

With the Gameblabla's Wrapper, you can :
- Draw Pixels on screen
- Move images and sprites
- Play music and sound effects
- Play with a keyboard or a controller

All of this with the same piece of code !
The only differences are the limitations of each platform and library.
