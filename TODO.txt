 
ROADMAP (TO DO LIST)

- Provide functions for text drawing
	'nuff said. (The problem is that i still don't know how to use the same bitmap several time without loading a second copy...)

- Improve Allegro5's keyboard reponsiveness (It is strangely laggy and has high latency)
	Add Joystick support as well.

- Test all unsupported platforms
	Platforms like the GCW Zero are untested, which means that i don't even know if they compile well or not.

- Improve Sprite support
	Except for the 3DO, sprite tables need to be horizontal.
	Improve this.

- Have at least basic support for the Jaguar. 
	Right now, this is not coming well and it will require some modifications to the original source code of your game to work.
	Programming for 3DO is easier than on the Jag. (Sorry Jaguar fans out there !)

- Have better PSP support
	Using a better 2D library could be a better choice for better performence.

- Improve Dreamcast's port
	Use Ph3nom's libgl for graphics and add WAV stream support.
	Improve sound support overall because it's somewhat broken.

- Improve GCW Zero's port
	Use OpenGLES instead for graphics.
	
- Support for the NEC PC-FX
	Liberis works but is is still in its infancy and right now, it's very low level.
	
- Add Android/OUYA support
	With virtual gamepad as well.
