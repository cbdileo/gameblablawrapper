---------------------
Version 6.3
---------------------

3DO version was broken.
In fact, some things like Music does not work properly...
Helicopters and Pal detection is now working properly.

---------------------
Version 6.2
---------------------

This version should improve speed as the awful input detection code is now shorter and faster.
The TI-Nspire CX port was greatly improved and it uses n2DLib for graphics instead of nSDL.
A special version n2DLib is provided, as the stock one will not work.

(The 3DO version might not compile btw but it should)

---------------------
Version 6.1
---------------------

Scaling for the SDL1.2 port is now supported through SDL_gfx,
simply set the SCALING define and link it with -lSDL_gfx.

Load_Image, Load_SFX and Load_Music are now taking char constants,
make sure to update your code to take this in account.

Fixed Dreamcast's port sound support,
support for sound effects is still spoty though...

Some fixing here and there i forgot...

---------------------
Version 6.0
---------------------

Deprecated : FPS variable. It is now using a define called FPS_VIDEO instead.

New function : Draw_Pixel (Available on all platforms)
New platform : Gizmondo (Using GizSDL)

Fixed platform : Dreamcast
Moved Allegro5 port to BROKEN

General bug fixing as well.
A file called Example.c is here to help developers and enthusiasts to port it to other platforms.

This is the first version released on Github.
Now is the time to put it officially here rather than on my website.

---------------------
Version 5.1
---------------------

DROPPING COMPATIBILTY FOR OLDER VERSIONS

The new sound function became Load_SFX, Play_SFX and Unload_SFX.
Before, they were all called Load_GFX, Play_GFX and Unload_GFX.
This was a mistake in history and this is now fixed.

Some code cleanup and some bugs were fixed.

Added support for the Dreamcast version, music WAV files are not supported yet.

---------------------
Version 5.0
---------------------

CSFML is now working and fully supported. (Note : Only SFML's C binding is supported)
Joysticks are now supported for SDL 1.2, SDL 2.0, Allegro4 and SFML on PCs. (Allegro5's port doesn't support joysticks yet)

For SDL 1.2, you need to pass the JOYSTICK define like this to the compiler :
-DJOYSTICK

If this is not defined then joysticks won't work.

Why not make it the default behaviour ?
Because some SDL 1.2 ports does not support joysticks properly or they are not needed.

---------------------
Version 4.1
---------------------

Add new function Clear_image.

Fixes some of the warnings made by Allegro5.

You can set the UNIX define for better and faster sync. 
It defaults to SDL_Delay by default.

--------------------
Version 4.04
---------------------

It was not possible to show more than 255 images due to functions using an unsigned char.
Now, you can use up to 64000+ ids for images. (Including tiles)

--------------------
Version 4.03
---------------------

Fixed SDL2 port. (It did not compiled before)
Added a simple example. (A background shown on screen that can be moved)

--------------------
Version 4.02
---------------------

The TI-Nspire port did not worked properly, this is now fixed.
Tested and works on real hardware.
SDL_UpperBlit does not accept NULL surfaces so i had to put the size of the images instead.

Clear_images did not worked properly either and this affected all the versions except the 3DO port. 
This was an oversight and it's fixed of course.

--------------------
Version 4.01
---------------------

3DO PAL support is fixed, it did not worked properly.

-------------------
Version 4.0
-------------------

The 3DO version did not worked at all and it now works properly.
In addition, the 3DO version is PAL optimised ! (Black Borders)

Copy_Image did not worked at all, this is now fixed.
This function is stable and works properly on all backends, 
you should use it to minimise memory usage !

The NSPIRE, GCW and PSP ports could not be compiled, this is fixed too and they should work too.

The "MoveImage" example was removed but i'll bring it back, no worries.

The HeliCopt3rs sample was updated.
Its code now makes use of Copy_Image and it works on all platforms,
with the notable exception of file path and file extensions.

-----------------
Version 3.1
-----------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
!! Functions removed or deprecated !!
--------------------------------------------------------------
- KEY_DOWN is no more. I may reimplement it later
 
Fixed some issues :
- Clear_screen with Allegro 4 does nothing. (Not needed)

Examples :
- Helicopt3rs as a sample

-----------------
Version 3.01
-----------------

Fixed a bug with the SDL 1.2 version, some essential functions were missing !
Please update !

-----------------
Version 3.0
-----------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 !! Functions removed or deprecated !!
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 - Set_videomode is no more.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  New functions
 --------------------------------------------------------------

- Sync_refresh()
Sync with the FrameRate without refreshing the screen.
	
- Clear_Images();
Clears all the Images in Memory.
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DANGEROUS - DON'T USE WITH ALLEGRO 5 / SDL 2.0 !
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Faster_clearing()
Clears only a certain specified area.
	
- Faster_update()
Update only a certain specified area.
Very effective on Atari Falcon using SDL.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------
 Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------

  For Version 3.0 and Version 2.0, speed was greatly improved
  thanks to my efforts trying to port my secret project on Atari Falcon. (Specially Version 3.0)
  Note that the speed increase only affect SDL 1.2,
  which is used by the GCW Zero, PSP, Ti Nspire and PC ports.
  
  Unfortunely, the new functions do not work properly 
  with Allegro 5/ SDL 2.0 because they are constanly refreshing the screen
  so careful when you are coding your game. (or just don't use them)
	
-------------------
Version 2.0
-------------------
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 !! Functions deprecated or changed !!
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 - Unload_Music() is now Clean_Music()
	Its name had be changed because it conflicted with SDL_mixer.
	
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  Fixed
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 - The TI-nspire port didn't compiled well. This is fixed.
 - Some build warnings were fixed too. (but not all)
 
 ---------------
 Features
 ---------------
 
 - With game_name, you can choose the name of the window. (Usually not visible in fullscreen but oh well)

 Comments
 ---------------
	
 Version 2.0 is released and brings lots of improvements.
 First of all, support for Allegro 4 was added and it works quite great.
 
 The Allegro4 version is the only one to support Joysticks on PC.
 
 There's also full support for SDL2 and partial support for Allegro5 :
 Both of them support scaling for higher displays, which is nice.
 
 The Allegro5's scaling code is a bit different from the SDL2 version,
 but it should be very similar to the SDL2 version.
 I'm not sure though if that's the case for weird resolutions like 3/4 for example. (4/3 rotated 90Â°)
 Tell me if you spot any difference on any resolution.
 
 Something similar can be implemented for SDL 1.2 and Allegro 4 as well but that would be a hell lot slower. 
 (Scaling would be done entirely in software)
 Allegro5/SDL2 should be used for modern platforms while Allegro4/SDL1.2 should be used for old computers or video game consoles.
 
 If you are making a PC game using my library, you can decide to give the users the choice to choose their renderer.
 (Provided that you provide an executable for each different library)
 If the SDL 1.2 version doesn't work for example, then he/she can try the Allegro4-based version instead.
 
 This also mean that (almost) no users should be unable to run the game because the library used does not support their
 exotic graphic card, how cool is that ? 

------------------
Version 1.21
------------------
 
 Version 1.21 is quick and small release that is even easier to use.
 Before, you had to pass some defines to the compiler in order to properly support input for each platform. 
 Fortunely, this is no longer needed.
 
 This version also adds experimental support for GCW ZERO.
 This port is using TRIPLE_BUFFERING by default and almost everything
 is mapped to the buttons of the GCW Zero.

 TRIPLE_BUFFERING should give some speedups so its cool :)
 
-----------------
Version 1.2
-----------------

This version is much more usable in my opinon.
Hopefully you will like it more than previous versions because they were only good for moving picture on screen :d

--------------------------------------------------------------
!! Functions deprecated or changed !!
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Set_videomode() do nothing and is now deprecated. 
	As of now, the only supported video mode is 320x240
	Support for scaling to support higher displays is planned but it is not implemented right now.

-  Play_GFX(int i, int channel_number) is now Play_GFX(int i)
	Eventually, Play_GFX(int i, int channel_number) will be back
	but it didn't work properly so i had to change it.

-  UNCAPPED_FRAMERATE was removed from the TI-Nspire port

---------------
Features
---------------
- You only need to include the headers to use it now

- Building is now fully functional on GNU/linux machines (building with warnings)

- DEBUG messages are now provided. 
	Pass -DDEBUG and/or -DDEBUG_CRAZY to the compiler to enable them

- Now comes with provided with Makefile and Scons support

----------------
BUGFIXES
----------------
- Fix audio support for PC ports
- Fix Update_video(). Framerate was uncapped for all ports but this is now set to 60 FPS by default
- Fix the TI-nspire port, it should compile fine now

----------
Note 
----------
The 3DO should work well like before but i did not test it with this version.
Tell me if it doesn't work

-----------------
Version 1.1
-----------------

- Added Copy_Image() function. 
- Pink (RGB 255,0,255) is now transparent on all platforms.
- Added more documentation. (Including functions.txt)
- Fixed some bugs.

-----------------
Version 1.0
-----------------

First version with support working for 3DO and PC (SDL 1.2).
