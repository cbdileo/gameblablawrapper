So you want to use my library ?
Great !
I recommend you to use the provided example and make your game from that.

The reason why is because i'm providing a working Makefile for the example
and it's just easier than doing everything from scratch.
Refer to FUNCTIONS.txt if you want to know how to use my library.

HOW TO COMPILE THE EXAMPLE

_________
Windows

I highly suggest you to use and install Codeblocks with MinGW instead.
Create a new project and choose 'SDL project'.
Provide a directory where you have put the SDL libraries and headers.
After that, right click on the name of your project (on the middle-left of your screen) and choose 'add files' or something like that.

Then pick main.c and PC_SDL2.c.
If you are using SDL1.2 instead then choose PC_SDL12.c instead of PC_SDL2.c.

My library requires SDL_mixer for Sound support so don't forget to put it in the same directory as SDL !
SDL_image is also required if you are using any other format than BMP. 
Same thing, put it in the same directory as SDL !

Pass to the compiler this :
-DSOUND_ENABLED -DIMAGE_CODEC_ENABLED

Then you should be able to compile the provided example.

If you have installed MinGW instead of Codeblocks+MinGW then great, 
you only need to open the command prompt and type mingw-make in the same directory as the example.

Don't forget to put your libraries or headers in MinGW/lib and MinGW/include !

________________
GNU/Linux (*nix)
________________

If you have not installed Allegro or SDL then open your package manager (usually Synaptic or Muno) and search for Allegro and/or SDL.
Don't forget to install the dev version as well !

To compile the example, open a terminal in the same directory as the example and type make.
Or if you want to compile the Allegro4 version of the example, type instead : make -f Makefile.ALLEG4

That's pretty much it for GNU/Linux.

On BSD, you may have to use gmake instead.
