===========
PC (SDL 1.2)
===========

This port supports joysticks and keyboards.
Setting the UNIX define, you can have more accurate and better synchronisation.
The platform needs to support it, though.
Also, i'm setting the colorkey for all images because according to benchmarks,
RLE encoded images are faster than non-RLE images.
I'm using Displayformat to further speed up things.
These improvements can be noticeable on some platforms, especially on Atari Falcon.

===========
PC (SDL 2.0)
===========

For this port, i'm scalling it up to the whole screen.
This looks quite good and it is using the graphic card for doing this.
SDL 2.0 does consume 3x times more memory than SDL 1.2.
On modern hardware however, this port should be preferred.

===========
PC (Allegro4)
===========

This port is the fastest and the one that consume the least memory on old computers.
It also supports joysticks and was the first one to support them.
In theory, it should be possible to port your games to DOS thanks to this port.
I have not tested this however.

Sometimes, the refreshing is not what it should be, this needs more testing.

===========
PC (Allegro5)
===========

This port is not working very well right now but it could be my computer.
Compared to Allegro4, it's a real mess especially input.
It's laggy , slow and hard to use.
Allegro5 eats less memory than SDL 2.0 and SFML though so there's that.
I still hate Allegro5 but if anyone want to fix it, i'll gladly take your patches.

===========
PC (SFML)
===========

SFML is a nice library but its bindings are severely undocumented.
And unlike SDL 2.0 and Allegro5, there are no easy way to scale it to the whole screen.
That's why it's (by default) in Window mode but you can fill the whole screen, it just doesn't work in fullscreen.
Other than that, it works great.

===========
3DO
===========

This port works like the other ones though not it's not identical.
You can't clear images in memory, or at least i don't know how.
For now, (from version 5.0) it is only deleted from the display list.
You need to load a new one to completely delete it.

Another problem : PAL consoles.
The screen resolution is much bigger and the framerate is slower.
For the screen resolution, i used black borders.
That framerate thingy is still not solved though but it could be done easily.

It's just that i don't want programmers to accidently modify the FPS variable...

======================
DREAMCAST (Unfinished)
======================

For the Sega Dreamcast, i'm using SDL and several other libraries.
I'm only using SDL for video, not even for input.
For input, i'm using the input libraries provided by KOS.

For sound, i'm using tremor and XingMP3.
XingMP3 is GPL2+ thankfully so i don't have to change my license.

Basically, i'm simply looking at the file extension and determing
what library should i use for playing the music file.

It is still incomplete though.

First, i want this port to completely make use of the PowerVR by using ph3nom's libgl.
Second, i badly need code to stream WAV file music.
Working around the SPU reminds me of the 3DO,
when i had a hard time working with sound until i have found a workaround.  (still pretty hacky)

Anyways, it can be improved.

===========
GCW ZERO
===========

So you may be asking, why am i using SDL 1.2 and not SDL 2.0 ?
Firstly, scalling is not needed because i only support one screen resolution anyways.
Secondly, SDL 2.0 eats more memory than SDL 1.2.
Lastly, SDL2.0's new features are useless for the Gameblabla's Wrapper on GCW Zero.

This port can be improved though.
I could use OpenGLES instead for graphics.

===========
TI NSPIRE
===========

This port uses nSDL by Hoffa.
Sound is not supported on TI Nspire CX because it's a calculator. (i think that's obvious but some people still ask me this question)
If nRGBlib supports loading external files, then i will probably use that library instead in the future because it's way faster than nSDL.

===========
GIZMONDO
===========

This port uses GizSDL.
There's not really any alternative because most of other libraries on the web are gone, GONE.
End-users should use the Firefly's Launcher too, as WinCE mode is kinda shitty.
